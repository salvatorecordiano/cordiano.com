Hey!

Nice to meet you.

The best way to contact me is via e-mail. I usually answer within 1 day. If that doesn't happen, feel free to ping me on Twitter.

If you need to communicate with me privately, use [my PGP public key](https://cordiano.it/pgp/0xAA41FBBF4CAD56111076CE92E7AED55DEFB77973.pub.asc). Its fingerprint is `AA41 FBBF 4CAD 5611 1076 CE92 E7AE D55D EFB7 7973`. If you prefer modern alternatives, we can use Signal. DM me asking for my Signal number.
